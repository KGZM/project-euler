;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; 12^2 + 22^2 + ... + 102^2 = 385

;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
